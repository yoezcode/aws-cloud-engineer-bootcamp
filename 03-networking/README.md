# Networking

This section covers networking fundamentals required to understand both on-prem and cloud infrastructures.

Topics include:
- OSI and TCP/IP models
- IP addressing
- Subnetting and CIDR
- Routing and gateways
- DNS and basic protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.)
- Cloud networking concepts (VPCs, subnets, security groups)

The goal is to understand how data moves through systems and networks, and how cloud providers abstract and extend these concepts.

Strong networking knowledge is a core skill for any Cloud Engineer.
