## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services and other resources over the internet, with pay-as-you-go-pricing.

## 1. Cloud service models

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Virtual machines, storage, and networking
- Users manage the operating system, applications, and data

**AWS relevance:**
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual servers
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for scalable storage


### PaaS - Platform as a service
PaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- Users focus on application development

**AWS relevance:**
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy application deployment
- AWS Lambda for serverless computing


### SaaS - Software as a service
SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
- Users access applications through a web browser

**AWS relevance:**
- Amazon WorkSpaces for virtual desktops
- Amazon Chime for online meetings and video conferencing

## 1. Cloud deployment models

### Cloud (all-in cloud)
All resources are hosted in the cloud and accessed over the internet.
- Cost-effective and scalable
- Easy to manage and maintain
- Suitable for most applications and workloads

**AWS relevance:** 
AWS provides a wide range of cloud services for various use cases and industries

### Hybrid (partially in cloud)
Some resources are hosted in the cloud, while others are on-premises.
- Provides flexibility and control
- Allows for gradual migration to the cloud
- Can be more complex to manage

**AWS relevance:** 
AWS Hybrid Cloud solutions for integrating on-premises and cloud resources

### Private (on-premises cloud)
Resources are hosted on-premises data centers and accessed through a private network.
- Provides maximum control and security
- Can be more expensive and less scalable than public cloud
- Suitable for sensitive data and applications that require strict compliance

**AWS relevance:** 
AWS Outposts for extending AWS infrastructure to on-premises environments
