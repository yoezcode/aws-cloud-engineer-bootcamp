# Cloud Foundations

This section covers the fundamental concepts of cloud computing and AWS.

Topics in this area include:
- What cloud computing is and why it matters
- Service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
- Deployment models (public, private, hybrid)
- Core AWS concepts and terminology
- Shared Responsibility Model
- Regions, Availability Zones, and global infrastructure

The goal of this section is to build a solid mental model of how cloud systems are structured and why they are designed the way they are.

Everything that follows in this repository builds on these foundations.
