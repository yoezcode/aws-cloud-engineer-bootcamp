# AWS Cloud Engineer Bootcamp

This repository documents my learning journey through an AWS Cloud Engineer bootcamp.  
It serves as a structured knowledge base containing notes, explanations, and practical insights across core IT and cloud topics.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build a solid foundation in cloud engineering concepts  
- Deepen my understanding by explaining topics in my own words  
- Create a long-term reference for myself  
- Make my learning process transparent and reproducible  

## Philosophy

This is not a copy of course slides.  
Every file represents my own understanding of a topic, written to reinforce learning and make knowledge stick.

Learning is treated as an engineering process:
- Break down complex systems  
- Understand how parts interact  
- Document clearly  
- Iterate and improve  

This repository will grow continuously as the bootcamp progresses and new topics are introduced.
